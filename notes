✅ 1. LOGGING — “Diary of your application”
Logging means your app writes down everything important that happens — like a diary or CCTV footage.

✅ 2. BACKGROUND TASKS — “Do it later while user is free”
Background tasks mean the user gets the response quickly, and the heavy work continues in the background after the response is sent.

4.Axios

What it is: A tool for making API calls.

Better than fetch: Easy syntax, handles JSON automatically, can add headers like tokens.

axios.get('/tasks', { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } })


Analogy: Axios = VIP waiter who understands special requests easily.
